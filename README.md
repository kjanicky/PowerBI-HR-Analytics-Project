# PowerBI-Learning-Projects
Power BI dashboards that I have built during my learning process
# Case Study HR Analytics in Power BI
Firsly I create DimDate table using DAX. Then I im making sure that there are correct relationships connecting my fact and dimensions tables. Lastly using DAX I created measures that track Attrition Rate in % or track perfomance of invidual workers based on the ratings they got working in our company.
In this dashboard I dive into data about our workers in hypothetical company Atlas Labs. I made overview page with basic information about workers in our company. In the Demographics Page we look at demographic insights. Perfomance Tracker is page dedicated to track individual worker and his ratings. 
Attrition page is created for detailed look at Attrition Rate in our company. Overall this dashboard could be used to identify problems with workers leaving our company and the reasons for it.
# Report Design in Power BI
In this report I have been mainly focused on learning proper design techniques to enchance my report appearance. I created interactive storytelling report using bookmarks with buttons and charts that are only visible when we select the certain scenario (progressive disclosure). I also created customized theme and did a mobile layout with a bookmark navigator.
